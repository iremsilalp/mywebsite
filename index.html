          <h4>Home Server</h4>
          <p>I undertook a transformative project by repurposing an old laptop into a functional server using Linux Ubuntu and Portainer. <br><br>This involved meticulously formatting the laptop, setting up Ubuntu as the operating system, and leveraging Portainer to streamline Docker container management. <br><br>By configuring and optimizing this setup, I not only enhanced the laptop's capabilities but also gained valuable experience in system administration and server deployment.</p>

          <h4>Transitioning a Monolithic Application to Microservices Architecture</h4>
          <p>As part of Turkey's largest telecommunications company's Cloud Computing Bootcamp, I undertook a comprehensive and detailed project focused on transforming a monolithic application into a microservices architecture. This project was designed to address real-world challenges such as scalability, performance bottlenecks, deployment inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities.  

I worked on every aspect of this project, gaining hands-on experience with modern cloud-native tools and technologies. My responsibilities included:  
- **Architecting the Solution**: Designed a robust microservices architecture tailored to the application's requirements, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.  
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Utilized Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration to streamline deployment, enable scalability, and enhance fault tolerance.  
- **Database Selection**: Evaluated and selected the most suitable database solution, balancing performance, flexibility, and scalability to meet the system’s data requirements.  
- **API Integration**: Implemented APIs to ensure seamless communication between services, emphasizing security and efficiency.  
- **DevOps Practices**: Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments and faster delivery and used Git for version control and collaboration.
- **Optimization and Documentation**: Optimized deployment processes and created detailed documentation for the architecture, enabling easy adoption and scalability by future teams.  

This project was a pivotal learning experience, allowing me to deepen my expertise in cloud computing, microservices, virtualization, and modern development practices. It also honed my ability to analyze complex systems, identify optimal solutions, and deliver a well-rounded proposal that meets both technical and business objectives.</p>
